"""
Given an array of positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to N where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array. Your task is to count frequency of all elements from 1 to N.

Note: Expected time complexity is O(n) with O(1) extra space.

Input:
First line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, first line contains an integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
For each test case, output N space-separated integers denoting the frequency of each element from 1 to N.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 <= A[i] <= 106

Example:
Input:
2
5
2 3 2 3 5
4
3 3 3 3

Output:
0 2 2 0 1
0 0 4 0
